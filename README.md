# Web-API-using-EF-Code-First---Teacher-and-ClassRoom

@all - Our today's discussion topic was how to connect our Web API project to SQL Database using EF Code First approach

 As discussed do the followings:
Create 2 projects in solution - One web API and another class Library project for DB operation
Create 2 Classes Teacher and Classroom with one to many relationship (One teacher will teach in multiple classroom)
Create DB Model, and write method using Get, Post, Put, Delete and patch to do select and CRUD operation
Follow the right naming convention, DB type and length for DB fields (I have already given the feedback to everyone who came for assignment evaluation)
Make use of auto mapper
Run Sonar Report and fix all issues
